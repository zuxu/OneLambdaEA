# Self adjusting (1, 位)-EA with (1:s+1)-rule

This repository contains codes for generating figures in the following 2 papers by M. Kaufmann, M. Larcher, J, Lengler, and X. Zou:

1. [Self-adjusting Population Sizes for the (1,位)-EA on Monotone Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00531)
2. [OneMax is not the Easiest Function for Fitness Improvements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07017)
